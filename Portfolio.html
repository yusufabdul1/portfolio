    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Yusuf Abdul. I'm an 18 year old aspiring software engineer recently admitted to Moringa school in hopes that i finally manage to achieve the software developing dream that has been with me for a very long time. I'm a heavy gamer and f1 fanatic, always get confused when anything about football is talked about in any way.

    <h2>learning</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™ve been through multiple forms of learning which caused me to gain an interest in softwrae development. From writing on MsWord and playing with slides, they all had me wondering why I didn't just decide to make my own website. Eventually my wants and interests landed me here at moringa where I can finally fulfill my interests and software developing goals. Maybe even make one or two websites that'll eventually trend like Twitter/x and so on; or atleast be part of the development team.</p>
